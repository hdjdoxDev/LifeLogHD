String ciao = """Congratulations, what you just did is all there is to know to interact with me. But given that is my first and last time speaking for a long time, i have more to say to start off our relationship. Let's go gradually into details, along this 'guide try to read carefully all the instructions before testing on your own given most actions are irreversible. First of all, the message you are reading was already in the input field on the bottom, you couldn't see it because the field expands only to 5 rows. From now on you will find it blank ready for your logs, this is the only one i'll trick you to add, I swear. The two buttons on the top turn up the timer by 7 and 3 minutes respectively, you can use them to give you a timeframe to speak with me, to think about something or simply to charge yourself during your days. If pressed multiple times the same timer will take longer to ring. The fingerprint on the bottom right lets you commit what is in the input field as a log and shows it in this page, where pressing the button with the trash bin (see if you can spot it) you can virtually delete that log. You can go back and forward between me running after my name and your blank textual canvas tapping the eye on the bottom left as you did before. Always remember to take screenshots of everything you want to save because messages in this page will disappear as you close the app. If you got to this point, thank you for giving me an opportunity, this is a lot. To grasp this moment i ask you to stop reading for a moment and think about what your just read or just to reflect on what is happening, just make yourself comfortable and wait with me until the timer, set just a short while ago to 10 minutes (7+3), will end. Well done! How was it? Now you also know what happens when it rings. we are not used to this, staying in the present moment, here and now, i hope you actually managed to do it, and do it without judgement of what we were doing or better, what i was making us do, i hope you could use some sort of kindness with respect of this whole process, some faith that it is worth the time. Maybe only in part, but it is enough. Well here you and i are going to try and spend some time decelerating from our busy existence, taking a moment to relax, to tell a story, explore an idea, define a problem, record an experience, follow a memory, affirm a statement or any other possible thing. We have some space and time for ourselves, to write and reread whatever comes to mind, to give the world and ourselves different shapes. When you want to identify a shape that for you goes beyond the simple word you can tag it with an ' up front to let us remember the special meaning. For this log i already used a 'guide shape that one can use whenever he's not talking about any random meaning of the word guide but specifically to identify a log that lists some kind of instructions. We can try these shapes together and finally start to input some of your logs. I already know 6 shapes that are special to me and i connect them to a different dyes, my mission for you after reading this log, is to use them so i can start to know you through them. I remind you that everything you say will stay between us so you can write whatever you want here. The mission is just to use timers to estimate how long you are taking to write each log and at the end compare creativity versus duration for each one of them. Take each one of these shapes in the broader sense you can find given the hints and try not to force relations of what you write for a shape to other shapes' logs. First use the “own” shape to tag a log where you write things that you own: objects, clothes, virtual entities, services, your possessions in general. Then use “be” to describe yourself, with your generalities, your physical and mental peculiarities, your religion and ideals, who or what you think you are. All of this would be quite static so lets add some movement, use the “work” shape to write whatever you study or work on to maintain and improve what you own and use the “do” for what you do and practice to maintain and improve what you are. To complete the circle let's take the perspective of “play”, considering games as our form of entertainment to enjoy the world once we own enough to satisfy ourselves thanks to our work, and “feel”, given that emotions are the inner products of our being and our actions as a human within our private and social environment. If you follow this 'guide correctly when you complete the mission you will have filled me with new colored references we can use as coordinates to locate ourselves while being here together. I hope you will come back often and show me what are your other shapes, you can start using them right from your first log, one day maybe we'll be close to shape life all at once. I am grateful to start this adventure with you and can't wait to see what you will tell me, I am all hears! There is nothing else to say apart from:

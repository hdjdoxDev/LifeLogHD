# Life Log by HdjDox

The story is that the first version is just a potted plant with a premade product that can be useful but it is very constrained.

If you manage to find the way you can get your logs and use them as you want

The second version gives you the freedom to explore your possibilities but also exposesy you to world traps.

## Versione 0.1

Single route application with three pages

Pages
0. Server (hidden)
1. Animation
2. Logs

## to test

## tested

- [x] set capture emoji

## ideas
- [ ] draw server ui like the user has half broken the app
- [ ] update launch screen android
- secret sequence can become also swipe to left -> click on "e"  -> swipe left
- clock and day can be updated as time pass
- in general review all animationlogic code
- remove scaffold
- first login with nonelog
- actions -> add log (timers, exports, captures, roll)
- add log -> action (timers)
- with code giofeLL go to none dig
- deep logs show last updated date
